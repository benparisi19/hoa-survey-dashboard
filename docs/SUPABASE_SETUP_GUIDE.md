## üéõÔ∏è Step 4: Explore Your Data

### Using the Table Editor (Easy Mode)

     - Filter `q1_preference` contains "Opt out" to see who wants to leave
   
3. **View Individual Responses**:
   - Click any row to see full details
   - Use the response_id to cross-reference across tables

### Using SQL Queries (Power Mode)

1. **SQL Editor Queries**:
   - Click "SQL Editor" ‚Üí "New query"
   - Try the example queries below

## üìà Useful Analysis Queries

### Quick Overview
```sql
-- Get basic statistics
SELECT * FROM survey_summary;
```

### Service Rating Analysis
```sql
-- Count by service rating
SELECT 
    q2_service_rating,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) as percentage
FROM q1_q2_preference_rating 
WHERE q2_service_rating IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY q2_service_rating
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Preference Analysis
```sql
-- What do people want?
SELECT 
    q1_preference,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) as percentage
FROM q1_q2_preference_rating 
WHERE q1_preference IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY q1_preference
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Find Responses with Issues
```sql
-- People reporting landscaping problems
SELECT 
    r.response_id,
    r.address,
    r.name,
    q4.irrigation,
    q4.poor_mowing,
    q4.property_damage,
    q4.other_issues
FROM responses r
JOIN q4_landscaping_issues q4 ON r.response_id = q4.response_id
WHERE q4.irrigation = 'Yes' 
   OR q4.poor_mowing = 'Yes' 
   OR q4.property_damage = 'Yes'
ORDER BY r.response_id;
```

### Equipment Ownership Analysis
```sql
-- Who has landscaping equipment?
SELECT 
    'Lawn Mower' as equipment,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN lawn_mower = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) as owners,
    COUNT(*) as total_responses,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN lawn_mower = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as percentage
FROM q8_equipment_ownership

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Trimmer' as equipment,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN trimmer = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) as owners,
    COUNT(*) as total_responses,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN trimmer = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as percentage
FROM q8_equipment_ownership

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Blower' as equipment,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN blower = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) as owners,
    COUNT(*) as total_responses,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN blower = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as percentage
FROM q8_equipment_ownership;
```

### Complete Response View
```sql
-- Get all data for a specific response
SELECT * FROM complete_responses 
WHERE response_id = '019';  -- Change to any response ID
```

### Cross-Reference Analysis
```sql
-- Compare service rating vs preference
SELECT 
    q1.q2_service_rating,
    q1.q1_preference,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM q1_q2_preference_rating q1
WHERE q1.q2_service_rating IS NOT NULL 
  AND q1.q1_preference IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY q1.q2_service_rating, q1.q1_preference
ORDER BY q1.q2_service_rating, count DESC;
```

## üì± Step 5: Share Access (Optional)

### For HOA Board Members:

1. **Invite Users**:
   - Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Team"
   - Click "Invite a member"
   - Add their email
   - Choose role (Owner/Admin/Developer/Read-only)

2. **Read-Only Access**:
   - For board members who just need to view data
   - They can use Table Editor but not modify data

### Generate Public Links:
- You can create shareable dashboard views
- Use the API to create custom reports
- Export data to Excel/PDF for presentations

## üîß Step 6: Advanced Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Uncomment RLS policies in schema if you need access control
- Useful if different people should see different data

### Real-time Subscriptions
- Get notified when data changes
- Useful if you're still collecting responses

### API Access
- Auto-generated REST API for your data
- Useful for building custom dashboards or integrations

## üìã Maintenance

### Adding New Responses:
```sql
-- If you get more survey responses, insert them like this:
INSERT INTO responses (response_id, address, name, email_contact, anonymous) 
VALUES ('114', '123 New St', 'John Doe', 'john@email.com', 'No');

-- Then add corresponding data to each question table...
```

### Data Export:
```sql
-- Export complete dataset
SELECT * FROM complete_responses;
```
- Copy results and paste into Excel
- Use browser tools to download as CSV

### Backup:
- Supabase handles backups automatically on free tier
- You can also export your schema and data manually

## üéâ You're Done!
