# Phase 4 Authentication Test Checklist

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Middleware Redirect** - Fixed redirect from `/login` to `/auth/login`
2. **Supabase Auth Integration** - Access requests now create actual Supabase Auth users
3. **Invitation System** - Invitations create/link Supabase Auth users on acceptance
4. **RLS Policies** - Created comprehensive policies using auth.uid()

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### 1. Public Access Request Flow
- [ ] Navigate to `/request-access` (no login required)
- [ ] Search for a property
- [ ] Submit access request with email and relationship
- [ ] HOA admin approves request at `/admin/access-requests`
- [ ] Verify Supabase Auth user created in auth.users table
- [ ] Verify person record has auth_user_id linked
- [ ] User receives magic link email (check console logs)
- [ ] User can sign in with magic link

### 2. Property Owner Invitation Flow
- [ ] Property owner signs in
- [ ] Navigate to property details page
- [ ] Click "Invite Resident" button
- [ ] Fill invitation form with email and permissions
- [ ] Submit invitation
- [ ] Copy invitation link from console/response
- [ ] Open invitation link in incognito window
- [ ] Accept invitation (creates Supabase Auth user)
- [ ] Sign in with magic link

### 3. Magic Link Authentication
- [ ] Go to `/auth/login`
- [ ] Enter email address
- [ ] Click "Send Magic Link"
- [ ] Check Supabase Auth Logs for magic link
- [ ] Use callback URL to complete authentication
- [ ] Verify redirect to dashboard
- [ ] Verify user profile loaded with accessible properties

### 4. Row Level Security Verification
- [ ] Sign in as resident
- [ ] Verify can only see assigned properties
- [ ] Verify cannot see other residents' data
- [ ] Sign in as property owner
- [ ] Verify can see all residents of owned properties
- [ ] Sign in as HOA admin
- [ ] Verify can see all properties and residents

### 5. Session Management
- [ ] Sign in successfully
- [ ] Refresh page - should remain signed in
- [ ] Navigate between protected pages
- [ ] Sign out from dashboard
- [ ] Verify redirect to login page
- [ ] Try accessing protected page - should redirect

## üìù Database Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check auth users created
SELECT id, email, created_at, email_confirmed_at 
FROM auth.users 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check people linked to auth users
SELECT person_id, first_name, last_name, email, auth_user_id, account_status 
FROM people 
WHERE auth_user_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Check property access
SELECT pr.*, p.first_name, p.last_name, prop.address
FROM property_residents pr
JOIN people p ON p.person_id = pr.person_id
JOIN properties prop ON prop.property_id = pr.property_id
WHERE pr.verification_status = 'verified'
ORDER BY pr.created_at DESC;

-- Check pending invitations
SELECT pi.*, p.address, inviter.first_name as inviter_name
FROM property_invitations pi
JOIN properties p ON p.property_id = pi.property_id
JOIN people inviter ON inviter.person_id = pi.inviter_id
WHERE pi.status = 'pending';
```

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

1. **Email Integration**
   - Set up email provider (SendGrid, Resend, AWS SES)
   - Update endpoints to send actual emails
   - Customize email templates

2. **Production Configuration**
   - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL environment variable
   - Configure Supabase email templates
   - Enable email confirmation requirements

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Password reset flow
   - Email change flow
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Session timeout configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- All auth operations require SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- Magic links are logged to console in development
- RLS policies require executing PHASE_4_RLS_POLICIES.sql
- Invitation links include full domain (configure NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL)
