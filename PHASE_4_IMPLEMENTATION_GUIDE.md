## 🗄️ **Database Setup**

**REQUIRED**: Execute the RLS policies in Supabase to enable authentication:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Execute**: `/PHASE_4_RLS_POLICIES.sql` (the only SQL file you need to run)
3. **Verify**: All policies created successfully

The database schema is already in place. The RLS policies file contains all necessary Row Level Security policies for authentication and property-based access control.
